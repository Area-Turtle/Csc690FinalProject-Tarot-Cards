# Csc690FinalProject-Tarot-Cards

Proposal:

So what I plan on doing is create a tarot card reading app. The tarot card reading is a pretty old idea, and this app will work by grabbing 7 random cards from the deck and combing them into a hopefully coherent sentence

Tarot card [meanings](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list)

## Original (4/15/21)

## Must haves:
- The app will randomly draw out at least 3 cards from the deck.

- At total of 78 cards. 
	- Each card has its own fragment for a prediction
	- 22 Major Arcana
	- 56 Minor Arcana
		- 14 Suit of Wands
		- 14 Suit of Cups
		- 14 Suit of Swords
		- 14 Suit of Pentacles 
- Will have the option to select between only the major or minor or for it to pick though the combined deck


- Locations for "local" tarot card reading business
	- Will include contact, hours, pricing
	- Based on cards drawn will print out response

## Nice to have:
- Stores responses
- Delete/clear responses
- Sentence is grammatically correct
- Will include reverse arcana
