# Csc690FinalProject-Tarot-Cards

Proposal:

So what I plan on doing is create a tarot card reading app. The tarot card reading is a pretty old idea, and this app will work by grabbing 7 random cards from the deck and combing them into a hopefully coherent sentence

## Must haves:
- The app will randomly draw out at least 7 cards from the deck.
- At total of 78 cards one for each of the arcana.
	- Potentially double the amount to accommodate different versions of the card.
	- Each card has its own fragment for a prediction
- Will have the option to select between only the major or minor arcana or for it to pick though the combined deck
- Locations for "local" tarot card reading business
	- Will include contact, hours, pricing
	- Based on cards drawn will print out response

## Nice to have:
- Stores responses
- Delete/clear responses
- Sentence is grammatically correct
