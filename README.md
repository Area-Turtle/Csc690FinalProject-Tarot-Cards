# Csc690FinalProject-Tarot-Cards

Proposal:

So what I plan on doing is create a tarot card reading app.

	Must haves:
 	-The app will randomly draw out at least 7 cards from the deck.
 	-At total of 78 cards one for each of the arcana.
		-Potentially double the amount to accommodate different versions of the card.
		-Each card has its own fragment for a prediction
 	-Will have the option to pick between major or minor arcana for a prediction or for it to pick though all of them
 	-Locations for "local" tarot card reading business
		-Will include contact, hours, pricing
		-Based on cards drawn will print out response

	Nice to have:
 	-Stores responses
 	-Delete/clear responses
