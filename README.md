# Csc690FinalProject-Tarot-Cards

Proposal:

So what I plan on doing is create a tarot card reading app. The tarot card reading is a pretty old idea, and this app will work by grabbing 7 random cards from the deck and combing them into a hopefully coherent sentence

## Must haves:
(Warning somewhat big project due to the number of images)
- The app will randomly draw out at least 3 cards from the deck.

- Seperate pages for for each section of the app. (Three total)
	- Home Page
	- Card Index
	- Card Reading

- At total of 78 cards. 
	- Each card has its own fragment for a prediction
	- 22 Major Arcana
	- 56 Minor Arcana
		- 14 Suit of Wands
		- 14 Suit of Cups
		- 14 Suit of Swords
		- 14 Suit of Pentacles 

## Nice to have:
- Stores responses
- Delete/clear responses
- Sentence is grammatically correct
- Will include reverse arcana
- Will have the option to select 3 cards between the major or minor or for it to pick though the combined deck
- Locations for "local" tarot card reading business
	- Will include contact, hours, pricing
	- Based on cards drawn will print out response

Time estimations:
-So overall I don't think it will take very long to program everything that I wanted. 24hr max.
-Assets(Images) will probably take around 2-3hr to get everything into the folder.
-Home menu will probably take 1hr. 
-The biggest hurdels for me is the draw card section and the index section.
	-The draw card section should not take more then 6hrs to code. 
	-The Index I assume will be about the same amount of time.
-Everything else will be ironing out the kinks/debugging.
